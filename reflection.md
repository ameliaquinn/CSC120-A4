- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

At first I was really, really confused by encapsulation and didn't quite understand how it fit, but after this assignment I think I get it a little more! There's definitely a learning curve starting to think about my code in terms of how all the pieces relate to each other and what they need to know about each other. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I eventually got the hang of relating my classes to each other and accessors, however, I think my code is definitely not as concise as it could be. There are definitely some redundancies / some public classes that don't need to be, so I think I would tell someone taking this course in the future to think a couple steps ahead when you're coding. Asking yourself what you are making and what you will need this for in the future will save you a lot of trouble in the long run!
